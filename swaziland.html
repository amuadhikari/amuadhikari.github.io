									<h1>Innovation Park Swaziland</h1>
									
									(Professional Project)								
								</header>
								<p>This is my first project as a graduate student at Virgina Tech. It is a sustainable 
									prototype of an affordable single family house for the Orange county 
									sustainability decathalon 2023 in California. The design was developed on the basis of technological 
									innovation, optimised performance, sensible use of materials and environmental concerns.

									The 1115 sqft. house is made of several modules. These prefabricated cartridges and 
									panelised building parts could be manufactured in a factory under controlled conditions 
									of temperature and humidity leading to higher efficiency in construction and greatly 
									reducing environmental pollution. The modular components  would be transported to the 
									site on standard oversized trailers, thereby reducing onsite construction costs and time.</p>

								</figure>
								</div>
								<p>The design aims to achieve affordability through efficient spatial planning and 
									operational efficiency. Due to this reason, special attention has been given to 
									the form of the structure with a butterfly roof. The inclined roof surfaces provide 
									for mounting of solar panels. The roof gutter helps in catching and storing of rainwater 
									which can be recycled to meet daily water needs of the single-family home. The butterfly 
									roof also allows for natural light to enter through the clerestory windows thereby cutting 
									down on artificial lighting needs of the house during daytime. Oriented along the east-west 
									axis the house opens to outside on two sides through openings onto decks in the south and north 
									direction. This connects the occupants to their natural surroundings, by providing a way for 
									natural light and cool air to enter the house. The overhangs over the decks provide cooler 
									outdoor spaces. Moreover, the functional butterfly roof also imparts a contemporary look to the house.</p>

									Fig2. The layout plan is designed on the concept of 
									a 'Serve' and 'Serviced' space, where the kitchen and 
									living room are the service spaces that serve the bedroom 
									and other interior spaces. These are segregated by service 
									cores such as washer/dryer, home office area, bathrooms, and 
									mechanical room. Prefabricated and prepackaged skinny cartridges such 
									as the living room cabinet, kitchen, and bedroom closet with a murphy bed 
									form the periphery of the house.

								<p>Materials: Structurally insulated Panels (SIPS) would be used as the primary 
									building material for the house due to several advantages it has over other
									 building materials. The method of constructing a building using SIPs uses significantly 
									 less energy than traditional construction methods. Panels are manufactured in factories 
									 offsite and transported to their final location, meaning minimal waste that goes to landfill 
									 and less noise pollution for businesses and residents in the area. SIPs consist of a rigid foam 
									 insulation layer sandwiched between two surfaces. This makes them much more energy efficient than 
									 traditional building materials. They regulate temperatures more efficiently, keeping interiors cool
									  in the summer and helping them retain heat in the winter. The insulation also helps reduce the 
									  amount of noise penetration, so they are much quieter homes for residents to live in. SIPs are 
									  thought to be about 50% more energy efficient than traditional timber framing. Homes are airtight 
									  and leak less heat, reducing energy bills for residents and decreasing carbon emissions being released 
									  into the environment. As all SIPs walls, roofs and floors can be designed and built precisely offsite, 
									  once the panels are transported into place, construction can take place very quickly. Buildings constructed 
									  with SIPs panels are also able to withstand extreme weather conditions. SIPs are also resistant to fire.</p>

								<p>Additionally, light weight concrete would be used for constructing the prefabricated 
									floor slabs. Compared to traditional concrete, lightweight concrete can weigh up to 35% 
									less, making it easier to handle and transport. This can lead to faster construction times 
									and lower labour costs. Lightweight concrete also offers other benefits, such as improved 
									thermal insulation, fire resistance, and sound absorption. </p>

								<p>Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) would be chosen for constructing the roof.
									 Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a prefabricated, solid engineered wood panel.
									 These panels are lightweight yet strong and stable. CLT is pre-machined and is a 
									 sustainable building material option (due to carbon sequestration). It has exceptional 
									 fire resistance properties, and it provides extreme noise cancellation within buildings. 
									 Also, Exposed CLT interiors can add to a building's aesthetic qualities (Biophilic element). 
									 Double glazed windows with high R-Value and low U-Value would be used for the openings making 
									 the house energy efficient. It also aids to noise reduction. </p>

								<p>The concept of prefabricated modular homes could be used to build multifamily
									homes in cities, to meet the growing needs of affordable housing. Through this design 
									problem I have tried to address the concern for homeless shelters/elderly homes in cities. Boxed
									 modules of size 12ft. x 18ft. are stacked to build a six-story high structure resting on a 2-story 
								     pedestal building that can house commercial and retail facilities for the residents. The 
									 stacking of the modules is developed in a way so as to create open green terraces on alternate floors that
									  would act as interaction zones for its occupants, many of whom are homeless 
									  and devoid of families. </p>
